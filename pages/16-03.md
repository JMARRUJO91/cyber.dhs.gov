## 2016 Agency Cybersecurity Reporting Requirements
This page contains a web-friendly version of the Department of Homeland Security's [Binding Operational Directive 16-03](/assets/report/bod-16-03.pdf), “_2016 Agency Cybersecurity Reporting Requirements_”.

*A binding operational directive is a [compulsory direction](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ283/PLAW-113publ283.pdf#page=2) to federal, executive branch, departments and agencies for purposes of safeguarding federal information and information systems.*

*The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) develops and oversees the implementation of binding operational directives pursuant to the [Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ283/PLAW-113publ283.pdf#page=3).*

*Federal agencies are [required](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ283/PLAW-113publ283.pdf#page=6) to comply with DHS-developed directives.*

*DHS binding operational directives do not apply to statutorily defined "National Security Systems" nor to certain systems operated by the Department of Defense or the Intelligence Community. [Id. § 3553(d)-(e)](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ283/PLAW-113publ283.pdf#page=5).*


### Background

Providing a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of
information security controls over federal information and information
systems requires centralized reporting of agency information security
incidents and the general information security posture of agencies.
Accordingly, FISMA requires agencies to report security incidents to the
DHS Federal information security incident center. The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), part of
DHS's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center
(NCCIC), serves as the Federal information security incident center.[^2] FISMA
further requires to provide annual reports to the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), DHS, and Congress on the adequacy and effectiveness of
information security policies, procedures, and practices[^3]. FISMA
itself specifies some of the requirements of these reports.[^4] But it
also requires DHS to issue Binding Operational Directives specifying
additional requirements for those reports.[^5] This directive satisfies
those requirements.

### FISMA Reporting Requirements

All agencies shall comply with the following requirements.

#### Requirements for Reporting Security Incidents to DHS

-   Report security incidents to US-CERT in accordance with the current
    guidelines found at <https://www.us-cert.gov/incident-notification-guidelines> which are updated as necessary.

#### Requirements for the 2016 Annual FISMA Reports

-   Agency Fiscal Year 2016 Annual FISMA Reports shall include the Chief
    Information Officer (CIO), Inspector General (IG), and Senior Agency
    Official for Privacy (SAOP) metric information detailed in the
    annual FISMA metrics located here:
    <https://www.dhs.gov/publication/fy16-fisma-documents>. This requires
    no additional action from federal agencies beyond the requirements
    stated in the [OMB Memorandum 17-05](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-05.pdf), *Fiscal Year 2016-2017 Guidance on
    Federal Information Security and Privacy Management Requirements.*

      _(**NOTE**: M-17-05 has been rescinded by [M-18-02](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/M-18-02%20%28final%29.pdf))_.

-   By November 10, 2016, the CIO, IG, and SAOP metrics shall be
    submitted to OMB and DHS via CyberScope.

#### Requirements in Preparation for the 2017 Annual FISMA Report

-   Agencies shall view the FY 2017 Annual FISMA CIO metrics available
    at <https://www.dhs.gov/publication/fy17-fisma-documents> and plan
    accordingly so they can include these metrics in their FY 2017 FISMA
    Reports.

### Progress Tracking

DHS will track submission of the reports required above and follow up
with OMB or the relevant agency to address non-compliance as
appropriate.
